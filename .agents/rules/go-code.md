# Go code

Refines the Go error handling and coding style rules.

- **GO1** `client.gen.go` is generated. Never edit it by hand. Change `config.yaml` or a spec patch in `scripts/`, then run `make generate`.
- **GO2** The current spec generates without patches. Future fixes belong in `scripts/`, applied from `gen.go` before generation. Each patch says in its header which spec problem it fixes.
- **GO3** The downloaded spec in `api/` is gitignored and never committed.
- **GO4** Unformatted number fields stay `float64` through the `type-mapping` in `config.yaml`. Explicit `format: float` fields remain `float32`.
- **GO5** Hand-written Go (`gen.go` and the tests) wraps errors with `ctxerrors.Wrap` against `ctxerrors/commerr` sentinels. No `fmt.Errorf`, no `errors.New` outside a sentinel declaration.
- **GO6** The exported API is whatever oapi-codegen emits. A config change that renames or removes an exported name is a breaking release (see `releases.md`).
- **GO7** `make lint` passes with zero issues. Hand-written lines are at most 80 columns, the `.golangci.yml` limit.
